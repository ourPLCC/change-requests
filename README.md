# ourPLCC change requests

The central tracker for work on the ourPLCC code repositories: plcc-ng,
languages-ng, plcc-ng-demo, plcc-ng-devcontainer, and course-materials-ng. It is managed with
[Backlog.md](https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md) and is the workflow guide
for maintainers and their agents.

**Reporting a problem or suggesting an idea?** Open a GitHub issue on the
relevant code repository instead. GitHub Issues are where humans talk to us;
this repository is where maintainers track the resulting work.

Checked against Backlog.md **1.53.0** (see `.backlog-version`). Agents: follow
this README, not `backlog instructions` — its guidance differs from ours on
plans, cleanup, and drafts.

## Setup

- Keep the ourPLCC repos as siblings on your host, with this repo cloned
  beside them as `issues/`. Each code repo's devcontainer clones it there if
  missing, bind-mounts it at `/workspaces/issues`, sets
  `BACKLOG_CWD=/workspaces/issues`, and installs the pinned `backlog` CLI.
- Commit inside the container; **push from the host**. Backlog.md commits
  every change automatically (`auto_commit: true`).
- Hooks in `.githooks/` run `bin/check.py` (Python 3, standard library) on
  commit and push; `core.hooksPath` is set by the devcontainer's
  `initializeCommand`.
- Hosts: Linux or macOS.

## Vocabulary

- **Change request (CR):** committed work in exactly one repo — a feature, a
  fix, or an infrastructure change — with testable acceptance criteria. ID
  `CR-N`.
- **Draft:** an idea we have not committed to. ID `DRAFT-N` (a separate,
  recycled sequence). Not on the board or in `task list`.
- **GitHub issue:** a conversation with a human on a code repo. Not tracked
  work.

## Filing

1. Search first, across all projects — duplicates and root causes often live
   in another repo: `backlog search "<words>" --plain`.
2. Can you write testable acceptance criteria? **Yes → CR** (even if *how* is
   still open). **No** (it is unclear *whether* we want it) **→ draft.**
3. Create it (only with the human's approval):

   ```bash
   backlog task create "<title>" --project plcc-ng --type fix \
     -d 'Why this exists: the problem or need.' --ac 'Testable criterion'
   backlog task create "<title>" --draft --project plcc-ng -d 'The idea.'
   ```

   Description = *why*. No implementation plan at filing time.

## Working a CR (superpowers flow)

1. **Brainstorm:** `backlog task edit CR-N -s "In Progress" -a @<name>`.
   Promote a draft (`backlog draft promote DRAFT-N`) once *what* is settled.
   The spec goes in the code repo's `dev-docs/specs/`; update the CR's
   acceptance criteria to match and add the spec as a reference:
   `backlog task edit CR-N --add-ref ../../../plcc-ng/dev-docs/specs/<file>.md`.
   Specs do not cite CRs.
2. **Plan and execute:** the plan lives in `.plans/` inside the worktree
   (gitignored) and is deleted with it. Plans are not kept. During automated
   execution, record discovered work in the CR's notes —
   `backlog task edit CR-N --append-notes "…"` — never as new CRs.
3. **Branch** `cr-N-short-slug`; the PR names the CR.
4. **Close after merge:** triage the CR's notes with the human (new draft,
   new CR, fold into an existing CR, or drop); check each acceptance criterion
   against evidence (`--check-ac 1`); write `--final-summary "Changed X,
   verified by Y."`; set `-s Done`.

**Close on verification:** when only a later event can prove the fix (e.g. a
real release run), leave the CR `In Progress` after merge and close it once
verified.

## Statuses

`To Do` → `In Progress` → `Done`. `Done` CRs move to `completed/` when a human
runs `backlog cleanup` (interactive) or `backlog task complete CR-N`; they stay
viewable by ID (`backlog task view N`) and greppable, but tool search and edit
no longer reach them. To reopen, file a new CR that cites the old one.

## Won't do, duplicate, obsolete

```bash
backlog task edit CR-N -s Done --add-label wontdo --final-summary 'Why not (for a duplicate: name the surviving CR).'
backlog task complete CR-N
```

**Never `backlog task archive`.** Archived CRs drop out of ID lookup, and
archiving the highest-numbered CR lets its number be reallocated.
`bin/check.py` fails if anything is in `archive/`. `--ready` treats a won't-do
dependency as satisfied, so review the CRs that depended on it.

## Drafts

- **Never cite a draft** — not in CRs, specs, commits, or branch names. If
  something must refer to a draft's content, copy the content. Promotion gives
  a new `CR-N` and does not rewrite old `DRAFT-N` mentions; draft numbers are
  reused. `bin/check.py` fails on any `DRAFT-N` outside its own file.
- **Demote** (`backlog task demote CR-N`) only when nothing cites the CR:

  ```bash
  grep -rn 'CR-N\b' /workspaces/issues/backlog /workspaces/<repo> --include='*.md'
  git -C /workspaces/<repo> log --all --oneline -i --grep 'cr-N\b'
  ```

  If it is cited, rewrite its acceptance criteria instead.

## Types and projects

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `fix` | A defect in a shipped package (bumps the patch version) |
| `feat` | New behavior in a shipped package (bumps the minor version) |
| `docs` | Documentation content |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `refactor` | Structure changes without behavior change |
| `chore` | Everything else: tooling, CI, build, devcontainer, this tracker, upkeep |

A CR's type is the conventional-commit type of the change that decides its
version impact; its branch may carry other commit types too.

Every CR has exactly one `project`: `plcc-ng`, `languages-ng`, `plcc-ng-demo`,
`plcc-ng-devcontainer`, or `course-materials-ng`. Work spanning repos is one
CR per repo linked with `--dep` (no umbrella CRs); `backlog task list --ready`
hides a CR until its dependencies are done.

## IDs

| Range | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CR-1`–`CR-399` | plcc-ng legacy issues, same number: plcc-ng `#160` is `CR-160` |
| `CR-400`–`CR-499` | plcc-ng legacy numbers used twice (035, 039, 043): the second at +400 |
| `CR-501`–`CR-699` | languages-ng legacy issues (+500): languages-ng `#12` is `CR-512` |
| `CR-801`–`CR-899` | plcc-ng-demo legacy issues (+800) |
| `CR-999` | Seed — do not touch |
| `CR-1000`+ | New CRs |

Lookups are numeric: `backlog task view 160` finds `CR-160`. Each migrated CR
ends with `Migrated from <repo> #NNN.`.

## References and links

- **Between CRs:** bare IDs (`CR-160`), never paths.
- **To code:** relative links written as if the CR is in `backlog/tasks/`:
  `[emit.py](../../../plcc-ng/src/plcc/java/emit.py)`. They resolve in the IDE
  for `tasks/` and `completed/`; inside a code repo's container, links into
  *other* repos do not resolve (only that repo and this one are mounted).
- **To specs:** in `references`, as such a link.
- **To GitHub issues:** full URL in `references`; comment on the GitHub issue
  with the CR ID.
- **From code:** the branch name `cr-N-…`. `git log --merges -i --grep cr-N`
  finds the merge; `git log M^1..M^2` lists its commits.

## Searching

`backlog search "<q>" --project plcc-ng --plain` or
`backlog task list --search "<q>" --project plcc-ng --plain` filter by project
(plain output does not show each hit's project; `--json` does). Search all
projects before filing.

## Pushing and collisions

Push from the host. If the push is rejected, `git pull --rebase`, then
`python3 bin/check.py`. If it reports a duplicate ID (two people allocated the
same number before either pushed), run `backlog doctor --fix` in a container
to renumber the unpushed CR, commit, and push. CI runs the same check plus
`backlog doctor` on every push; it can only alert, so fix problems by revert.

## Checks (`bin/check.py`)

Fails on: duplicate IDs (drafts included) or a filename that does not match its `id`; a
`DRAFT-N` cited outside its own file; a CR without exactly one configured
`project` or `type`; an unconfigured label; anything in `archive/`; and, with
`--pre-push`, uncommitted changes under `backlog/`. `CR-999` is exempt from
the project and type rules.

## Upgrading Backlog.md

1. Change `.backlog-version`.
2. Regenerate `upstream/<new>/` (`backlog instructions <guide>` for
   `overview`, `task-creation`, `task-execution`, `task-finalization`,
   `init-required`) and diff it against the previous version.
3. Fold relevant changes into this README and update the version it was
   checked against — in the same commit.
4. Rebuild devcontainers to pick up the new version.

## Migration tooling

`migrate/` converts legacy in-repo trackers (Python 3 standard library). For
plcc-ng: `python3 -m migrate.plcc_ng`, `python3 -m migrate.verify`,
`python3 -m migrate.repo_links`; decisions in `migrate/plcc-ng-triage.json`,
results in `migrate/reports/plcc-ng.md`. Tools that call `backlog` set
`BACKLOG_CWD` to their target explicitly.
